If you disconnect, reconnect, or add new Satellite surfaces on the local machine, Satellite should automatically detect the surfaces as they are attached.

If for some reason it does not detect it by itself, you can instead trigger a rescan from either the tray icon:
![Scan](images/scan.png?raw=true 'Scan')

or from the configuration page:
![Scan](images/scan.png?raw=true 'Scan')

They will then be detected as normal and appear in the 'Connected Surfaces' tab and in Companion.
